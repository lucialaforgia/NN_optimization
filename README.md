## Abstract
This repository contains a project for my Architecture and Platforms for AI course.
The goal of this project was to write two distinct programs, one using OpenMP library and one using CUDA platform and interface, to perform efficient evaluation of feed-forward, sparsely connected, multi-layer Neural Networks.
